# slimcc: A C11 compiler

This is a fork of [Rui Ueyama's chibicc](https://github.com/rui314/chibicc) that aims to fill in some missing features, compatibilities and fixes. 

Although not adopting chibicc's education oriented commit style, this fork aims to be consistent with its readability-first attitude and minimalistic approch, hopefully readers and fork-mates may find something useful.
